# <b>Yoyo Contest Judging</b> <br>a basic web app

## Overview


the yoyo community holds contests throughout the year they range in size and ability but all of them still use a pen and paper judging system hand entered into an excel spreadsheet that's printed out and posted.

# What's Next!

Essentially nothing is done on this project so. 
<br>- In some spare time I'd like to add:<br>

    ☐ A form on the index that allows a guest to select a competition and redirect to a view for that competitions information ( date and time, location, sponsors, etc)

    ☐ Add a new view to request to make contests

	☐ a judging form for people who are registered to a particular contests as a judge

	☐ static methods for the scores to do the math for scoring in the background

	☐ a flushed out results page that will allow anyone (even guests) to view the results of a given division of a given contest

    ☐ API interaction with the NYYL or IYYL to verify a competitors registeration in a contest or division so that nothing will need to be done on the users side to take full advantage of this site

    ☐ Add a new view to request to make a new contests (with confirmation the ability to approve or deny via the sites administrator

    ☐ Allow a contest organizer to upload their own html/css/js to the contests page to make the page personal to their contest

    ☐ the ability for judges to view their previous scores and modify them if they were input incorrectly (with tracking on the back end so each judge can be held accountable to their changes)

    ☐ and Many More!
